# Melanoma Image Classifier

This project builds a machine learning classifier to detect melanoma from images.

## Dataset
We use the [[HAM10000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)].  ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images/data)
Due to size and licensing, the dataset is **not included** in this repo.
